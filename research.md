* Local Economic Development and the Political Economy of Village Councils in India.

We examine the effect of caste identity of village council leaders in India on the choice of 
local policies using the quasi-random assignment of the leaders’ position to specific caste groups within sub-districts. 
Overall, we find weak redistributive effects suggesting that choice of policies may only be a small component of the 
politician’s objective function even at the lowest tiers of the political structure.

# Work in Progress

* Judicial Institutions and Economic Outcomes in India

This project aims to explore causal relationship between judicial frictions and economic outcomes using newly available micro-data on cases in Indian courts. We model judicial frictions along a number of dimensions, including annual speed of resolution, delays in trial processing beyond the stipulated time and probability of disposal in each period. Next, we merge these friction measures with sub-national level data on economic outcomes. To address the concerns of credible identification strategy, we exploit exogenous changes that affect judicial efficiency such as changes in judge strength through vacancies arising out of sudden death or accidental causes, roll-out of alternate dispute resolution mechanisms and prior period legislations that either induce or reduce these frictions.

* Irrigation Tanks and Collective Action: An Experimental Study (joint with Xavier Gine, Aprajit Mahajan and Anup Malani)
We study the conditions under which local water bodies (“water tanks” or simply “tanks”) can be successfully maintained following a one-time restoration by a centralized government agency.
