* Local Economic Development and the Political Economy of Village Councils in India.

We examine the effect of caste identity of village council leaders in India on the choice of 
local policies using the quasi-random assignment of the leaders’ position to specific caste groups within sub-districts. 
Overall, we find weak redistributive effects suggesting that choice of policies may only be a small component of the 
politician’s objective function even at the lowest tiers of the political structure.
